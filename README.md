A graph search visualizer inspired by this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/CgW0HPHqFE8?si=u6QbVQzU3J92_lPh). 

## TODO:
* Improve search by using Maps and Sets.
* Replace css class 'leaflet-control'
* Allow user to change color of specific lines.

## Stretch Goals:
* Allow filtering of highway tags in query.
    * Allow filtering of highway tags in drawer.
* Choose between different algos
* Add glow to visualizer
    * Try to render wireframe to see geometry first
* Pass a time variable to shader for glow fade
* Look for additional performance gains on React's side
    * Maps and Sets
